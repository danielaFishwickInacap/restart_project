## Description

This repository contains the [documentation](/docs/project.md) describing my final project, submitted as a requirement for graduation from the AWS re/Start program.

Additionally, it includes a [folder](/TruckSensorFiles/) with files used to deploy an IoT simulator that sends data metrics to AWS.

## Project Overview

Using an IoT device simulator, the data generated by an IoT device is collected, ingested, processed, analyzed and visualized in real time, through the implementation of a cloud-based solution.

The next cloud services are used to complete the solution presented in this project:

* AWS IoT Core
* Amazon Timestream
* Amazon Quicksight
* Grafana
